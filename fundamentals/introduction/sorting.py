# Some optional challenges to assess and refine your understanding:

# Print the length of the list.
#should have used a loop here but its super iefficient!

print(len(some_nums))

# Use antoher python built-in function and print the result.

# Remove an item from the list. Remember to verify that it was removed
print(some_nums)
some_nums.pop()
print(some_nums)
some_nums.pop(1)
print(some_nums)

# Utilize a method from the documentation and print the result.
